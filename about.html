        <h2>Who are we?</h2>
        <p>The <b>IAR Student Council</b> is a diversely skilled team with an evergreen presence in almost all spheres
            of
            Institute activities! This is accomplished by its subdivisions/teams, each of which works to meet the
            Council’s highest vision ie., to connect the alumni to the Institute, and bring to students and the
            Institute, their expertise and resources. It also works to encourage foreign students’ entry into the
            institute by enhancing our international perception. At the same time, students going to foreign
            universities, from the Institute, are given orientation sessions and guidance as and when required. The
            Council is the face of <b>IIT Madras</b> in the outside world and continuously engages in activities that
            enhance
            the value of “brand IITM”. Apart from innovative, impactful events like <i> “A Day At IIT Madras” </i> and
            <i> “Daan
                Utsav” </i>, it also generates top quality video content portraying life here, and the experiences of
            different
            sets of students.
        </p>

        <p>
            The expertise and resources we, as students, can gain access to from the alumni, is overwhelmingly large! It
            takes a coordinated effort to make this possible. Every team of the Council works towards this goal. We
            bring to you a brief description of what each of these teams do and how they contribute to this vision.
            Every team also offers its members a lot of perks and a steep learning curve. This article should help you
            decide which team it is that you are looking to join and how former members have felt about their tenure.
